    "### Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce an automated approach for controlling stormwater systems.\n",
    "Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient approach for identifying the optima in hard or not easily solved problems using classical optimization frameworks.\n",
    "Unlike Genetic Algorithms, which randomly explore the solution space, Bayesian Optimization identifies the optimum by efficiently exploring the solution space and learning a surrogate objective function.\n",
    "Bayesian Optimization uses Gaussian Process to learn the surrogate objective function and samples the solution space in regions with the highest uncertainty in the objective function.\n",
    "This approach reduces the number of samples(i.e., model runs) required for identifying an optimum. \n",
    "[Frazier (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811) provides an excellent introduction to Bayesian Optimization.\n",

    "### Control of stormwater systems using Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approach the control of stormwater systems as an optimization problem, where we identify the control actions that minimize an objective function. For example, the objective function can be the total flooding in the system or the total amount of loading at the treatment plant. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ actions = arg\\min Z(a) $$\n",

    "In this notebook, we consider the scenario where we set one control action for the entire event. \n",
