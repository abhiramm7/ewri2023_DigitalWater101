    "### Equal Filling Degree Control of Scenario gamma\n",
    "##### A Summary of Equal Filling Degree\n",
    "We will now set up an equal filling degree approach to control Scenario gamma. An equal filling degree approach aims to maintain each basin at the same relative fullness (aka filling degree). In this example, we will consider basin fullness based on depth (filling degree = current depth / basin maximum depth). However, depending on the objective of the control designer (i.e., you), equal filling degree can consider basin volume, pollutant load, etc. Many researchers have tailored and broadened the relatively simple equal filling degree approach for a number of use cases. For additional reading, we direct you to [Dirckx et al. (2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273137213_Real_Time_Control_From_Desk_Study_to_Full_Implementation), [Schutze et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2018.172), and [Mullapudi et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103600) as starting places.\n",

    "##### Getting Started ...\n",
